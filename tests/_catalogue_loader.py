"""Load the seed catalogue, filter to entries the v1 optimiser can construct.

Used by ``tests/test_catalogue_rediscovery.py`` to parametrise the
rediscovery test over the catalogue. As the catalogue grows (more Russell
rows, more McConaghy SnLm entries, finder discoveries, etc.) the test
suite grows automatically.

Filter rules — an entry is *constructible by the v1 optimiser* iff:

* ``trajectory_regime == "ballistic"`` (absent → defaults to ``"ballistic"``).
* ``primary == "Sun"`` (absent → defaults to ``"Sun"``).
* ``len(bodies) == 2`` — M5's free-parameter dimension assumes a single
  synodic pair; 3-body / VEM optimisation is M8 work.
* ``sequence_canonical`` is a strict 2-body alternation across exactly two
  encounters (e.g. ``"E-M"`` or ``"M-E"``). The v1 optimiser builds the
  corresponding M4 cell with sequence ``(body_a, body_b, body_a)`` and
  ``period_k`` from the entry. Entries with longer canonical sequences
  (e.g. ``"E-E-M-M"`` for 2-synodic McConaghy / Russell rows) need M4's
  structural enumeration to find the matching cell and are excluded
  here — they're constructible *in principle*, but wiring them up
  requires extra structural inference outside the v1 loader's contract.
* All entries in ``vinf_kms_at_encounters`` have non-null ``vinf_kms``,
  and ``len(vinf_kms_at_encounters) == len(bodies)``.
* ``period.k`` and ``period.years`` are non-null.
* At least one leg with non-null ``tof_days`` (read from
  ``trajectory.segments`` when migrated, else the legacy ``legs[]``).

Family-seed and citation-only entries (most fields ``null``) are filtered
out by the non-null checks above.
